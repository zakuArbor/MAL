     <div class="panel-body"><p>MAL (MyanimeList) is an anime and manga database with a large community of people 
       who use their services. MAL allow users to be able to keep track of their progress with anime they are currently 
       watching and records any anime they have completed or plan to watch. The unique thing that MAL stands out 
       compared to other anime and manga databases is the ability for users to personalize their list. Although users
       are not able to have complete control in personalization such as changing the html structure or add animation through JQuery,
       users have complete control over the style of the site through CSS. Users are able to create their own layout but are required
       to use the preexisintg html structure making it a challenge to personalize your list without having any control with the
       html structure and the limitations of only able to use css.</p> </div>
